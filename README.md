# RobustCartilageSegmentation

Source code for Panfilov et al. "Improving Robustness of Deep Learning Based Knee MRI Segmentation: Mixup and Adversarial Domain Adaptation", https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04126v3.

*To be released within November 2019.*

### Notice!

The camera-ready version contained a bug in Dice score computation for tibial cartilage on Dataset C. Please, refer to the arXiv version for the corrected values - https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04126v3.
